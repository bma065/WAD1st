                I am **Usaid Hussain**,a results-driven Junior Web Developer with a unique focus on elevating the digital presence and operational efficiency of restaurant businesses. Leveraging a robust foundation in HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript, I specialize in building fast, mobile-first web platforms that directly address real-world business challenges, such as streamlining manual booking and improving customer communication.

            My practical experience includes hands-on development for restaurants and a strategic mindset honed by my recent Microsoft Office Specialist certifications and advanced training in Excel data analysis (including PivotTables and data visualization). This blend of technical coding skills and business process proficiency allows me to deliver not just visually appealing websites, but tangible digital solutions that drive engagement and growth.

My career objective is to partner with forward-thinking food-service brands, applying technology and creative problem-solving to successfully navigate the digital landscape.
                </p>

                <p>
                My long-term career goal is to support global food-service brands in their digital transformation,
                leveraging creativity and technology to solve real business challenges.
